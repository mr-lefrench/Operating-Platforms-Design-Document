# Operating-Platforms-Design-Document
Final Project Software Design Document


1. Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The client is a software compant named The Gaming Room, who wishes to expand their current Android based game "Draw it or Lose It" into a multi-platform game. They wish for the game to be playable on all currently popular systems, which will require a client-server design which the server will communicate with the individual clients on multiple systems. 

2. What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

The strongest part of the documentation is the executive summary, design constraints, and domain model portion of the assignment. 

3. What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

The most helpful part of writing the design document was the ability to think threough the entire design and infrastructure of the code. Without the high-level design of each class and object interacting with each other, the portions of the project involded in writing code would have been more difficult. 

4. If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would try to improve on the sections in which i described the advantages and disadvantages of different systems for their individual processes, as well as my explanations and breakdowns of the systems. 

5. How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

After consideration I decided that I had written what I believed to be the most necessary to both the user and the clients experience. For a gaming application such as this, the most important consideration is security anf performance, as well as scalability. So in designing the software, The Gaming Room should follow my reccomendations which I made based on what I thought would grant the user the best performance and quick server response times while serving many users at the same time. This is important to consider as the end user is the most important person when it comes to the success of this project. 

6. How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

I started by considering the requirements of the project and then looking to find solutions that would fit within the constraints given. I would use a similar technique in the future, but with the ability to interate on a build, so that a project isn't necessarily completed when it meets all the software requirements, but has the ability to take learnings from the design process and incorporate them into a newer and improved version of the project.
